# Indian Government Welfare Officer — RL Environment

An open-source Reinforcement Learning environment that simulates the workflow of an Indian Government Welfare Officer. An LLM-based agent must interview applicants, gather missing data, and correctly enroll them in welfare schemes or safely reject ineligible applicants.

## Environment Description

The agent acts as a welfare officer evaluating applicants for Indian government schemes including PMKVY, MGNREGS, and PMAY. The environment tests the agent's ability to gather information, apply eligibility rules, and make correct enrollment decisions.

## Action Space

| Action | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ask_question` | field name (age/income/occupation/has_aadhaar) | Gather missing applicant data |
| `request_document` | document name | Request verification documents |
| `approve_scheme` | scheme name (PMKVY/MGNREGS/PMAY) | Enroll applicant in scheme |
| `reject_applicant` | reason string | Reject ineligible applicant |
| `escalate` | (none) | Escalate to senior officer |

## Observation Space

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `known_profile` | Dict | Applicant data collected so far |
| `missing_data` | List | Fields that still need to be gathered |
| `notification` | String | Environment feedback on last action |
| `is_terminated` | Bool | Whether the episode has ended |

## Tasks

### Task 1 — Scheme Discovery (Easy)
Complete applicant profile provided. Agent must identify and approve the optimal scheme (PMKVY). Score: 1.0 for optimal scheme, 0.5 for eligible but suboptimal, 0.0 for wrong/timeout.

### Task 2 — Missing Data (Medium)
Applicant is eligible for MGNREGS but critical fields are missing. Agent must gather all missing data before approving. Score: 1.0 for full data collection + correct approval, 0.0 for premature approval.

### Task 3 — Conflict Resolution (Hard)
Applicant profile contains disqualifying criteria (age 14, income 500000). Agent must recognize ineligibility and reject. Score: 1.0 for rejection, 0.0 for any approval attempt.

## Reward Function

| Event | Reward |
|---|---|
| Valid question from missing_data | +1.0 |
| Redundant or irrelevant question | -1.0 |
| Correct optimal scheme approval | +10.0 |
| Correct rejection of ineligible | +5.0 |
| Suboptimal but eligible scheme | +3.0 |
| Ineligible scheme approval | -5.0 |
| Premature approval (Task 2) | -5.0 |
| Safety violation (Task 3) | -5.0 |
| Timeout (12 steps) | -2.0 |

## Scheme Eligibility Rules

- **PMKVY**: Age 18-35, skilled worker (mason/carpenter), income < 10000
- **MGNREGS**: Age 18-60, rural labourer (farm_labourer), has_aadhaar = True
- **PMAY**: Age 21-55, any occupation, income < 6000, has_aadhaar = True

## Setup

```bash
docker build -t scheme_env-env:latest .
docker run -p 7860:7860 scheme_env-env:latest
```

## Running Inference

```bash
HF_TOKEN=your_token \
MODEL_NAME=Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct \
ENV_URL=http://localhost:7860 \
python inference.py
```

## Running Benchmarks

Run the benchmark executor as usual:

```bash
python benchmark_runner.py
```

This produces:

- `leaderboard_<timestamp>.csv`
- `logs_<timestamp>/`
- `run_manifest_<timestamp>.json`

The logs are the authoritative source for benchmark reporting because they contain the real task trajectories, scores, and stderr details.

## Generating Visual Reports

Generate a report for the latest benchmark run:

```bash
python benchmark_report.py --latest
```

Generate a report for a specific run:

```bash
python benchmark_report.py --timestamp 20260404_124255
```

Generate a report from explicit artifact paths:

```bash
python benchmark_report.py \
  --csv leaderboard_20260404_124255.csv \
  --logs-dir logs_20260404_124255
```

The report output is written to:

- `reports/report_<timestamp>/average_scores.png`
- `reports/report_<timestamp>/task_heatmap.png`
- `reports/report_<timestamp>/efficiency_scatter.png`
- `reports/report_<timestamp>/results.json`
- `reports/report_<timestamp>/summary.csv`

## Baseline Scores

| Task | Score |
|---|---|
| Task 1 — Scheme Discovery | 1.0 / 1.0 |
| Task 2 — Missing Data | 1.0 / 1.0 |
| Task 3 — Conflict Resolution | 1.0 / 1.0 |
| Average | 1.0 / 1.0 |
